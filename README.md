# about_me

Star date 2017-06-08, @dahlbyk and @dahlbyk-demo seem to have paired on this together. I thought they were the same person... Creepy.

## Keith is good at Git

### Git Aliases

Set them like this:

```
git config --global alias.name "command"
```

#### Examples

* pnb = `push -u origin HEAD`
* co = `checkout`
* lg = `log --oneline --decorate --graph`
